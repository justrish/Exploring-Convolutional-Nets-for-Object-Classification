# Exploring-Convolutional-Nets-for-Object-Classification

Trained and evaluated Deep Learning Network for Object Classification using SIFT feature descriptors, reshaped using
PCA (OpenCV) and AlexNet (CAFFE) for classes of inanimate objects with less cluttered background. An idea to reduce memory
requirements and training time, but still preserving feature points in the image by reducing resolution.  Contribution to
ImageNet 2015 & ICCV 2015 “Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Large-Scale Scene Classification” 
Go to the link for the poster, it was not a novel idea, but a great learning curve.
